[#answer]
C

[#explanation]

A Product Backlog item is complete when all of its features are completed, meet the Definition of Done, and it is not possible to create any further Increments out of it.

A Product Backlog item is not necessarily associated with a single Increment of Work. A PBI may get decomposed into multiple, smaller pieces and work. Work on a decomposed PBI can last multiple Sprints, with each Sprint producing an Increment that meets a Definition of Done for a given facet of that Product Backlog item. 

That's why PBIs are decomposed by the development team - to break them up into manageable pieces of work that can be spread out over time and be planned out more accurately.
