The Scrum Guide very briefly mentions burn-down and burn-up charts.

Don't worry too much about burn-down charts, as they are only briefly mentioned in the Scrum Guide.

"Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While
proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism." - The Scrum Guide.

A trend line displayed on a release burndown chart indicates the progress of a project over time. The release burndown chart is a visual representation of the amount of work remaining to complete a project, plotted against time. The generated trend line represents the expected progress of the project if it were to continue at the same rate as it has been progressing up to that point in time.

It is important to note that the trend line is a projection based on past performance, and it may not accurately predict the future progress of the project. It is a predictor, but it is not an _empirical_ measure. Empirical measures are preferred in Scrum.
