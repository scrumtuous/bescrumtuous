A trend line of a release burndown chart indicates how fast work is being completed relative to the original plan, and can help visualize progress toward completion of the component being graphed, be it a Sprint or a decomposed Product Backlog item.

"A burn down chart enables the team to visualize the progress on a project. A burn down chart includes work remaining on the Y axis against a timeline of the project on the X axis. Depending on the project, these charts can measure work as user stories, tasks, backlogs or other metrics."

- Project Management Tools, TechTarget, Jan 2020. M. Courtemanche.

The Scrum Guide only makes a short reference to burndown charts, and even then, it says they are not a replacement for empiricism.

You don't need to be a burndown chart expert, but knowing what one is will keep you from being caught off guard on the Scrum certification exam.
