The Sprint Goal must be finalized before the end of Sprint Planning and it cannot be changed throughout the Sprint.

According to the Scrum Guide, during Sprint planning, "the whole Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning."

Note that there are no 'development Sprints' in Scrum. There are just Sprints. There are also no:

- Sprint Zeros
- Release Sprints
- Infrastructure Sprints
- Integration Sprints

Furthermore, all of the Scrum Events take place within a Sprint. 

- The Sprint does not start after Sprint Planning. 
- The Sprint Review does not happen after the Sprint finishes

A Sprint starts, and then all of the events take place within that Sprint. And when a Sprint ends after the Sprint Retrospective concludes, a new Sprint begins immediately. There is no time between Sprints in Scrum.
