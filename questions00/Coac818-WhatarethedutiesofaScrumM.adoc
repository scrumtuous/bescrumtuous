The Scrum Guide says the Scrum Master is a leader who serves. Note that it does not say the Scrum Master is a 'servant-leader.' 

'Leader who serves' is the new terminology.

It is not the job of the Scrum Master to perform secretarial duties for the Scrum Team, nor is it the job of the Scrum Master to be a liaison between management and the developers.

The job of the Scrum Master is to:

- Act as a leader first and a servant to the team second
- Coach and facilitate the Scrum Team and the organization on the application of Scrum
- Ensure the rules of Scrum are observed and coach around instances when they are violated
- Cause the removal of impediments (_cause_ the removal, not actually _remove_)
- Help to create a psychologically safe space for everyone involved

A Scrum Master never expected to:

- Assigns tasks
- Disciplines developers
- Run the Daily Scrum
- Select Product Backlog items
- Cancel a Sprint (Only a PO can)
- Override the decisions of the developers

Coach, facilitate and behave as a leader who serves are the key responsibilities of the Scrum Master.
