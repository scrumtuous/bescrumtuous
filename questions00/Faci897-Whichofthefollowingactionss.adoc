[#explanation]

The Scrum Master is a leader who serves the team and as such, should never _tell_ the developers what to do. The Scrum Master coaches and facilitates and allows developers to discover solutions and solve problems themselves.

Furthermore, the Scrum Framework does not allow the length of a Sprint to be extended, and only the Product Owner can end a Sprint early.

The Scrum Master does coach teams about the Scrum Framework, so coaching a team to ensure the 15 minute Daily Scrum timebox is not exceeded is a good use of the Scrum Master's time.
