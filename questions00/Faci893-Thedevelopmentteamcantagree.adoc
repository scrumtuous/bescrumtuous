Coaching and teaching are important parts of the Scrum Master's role as a leader who serves.

Active listening and open questioning are important skills in effective communication, particularly in Scrum where collaboration and continuous feedback are key. However, there are other techniques and approaches that can also be useful in communication, including:

Reflective listening: This involves reflecting back what the speaker has said to demonstrate that you understand their message. For example, "So what I hear you saying is that you're concerned about the timeline for this project."

Summarizing: This involves summarizing what has been said to ensure that everyone is on the same page. For example, "Let me make sure I understand - you're saying that we need to focus on improving the user experience for this feature."

Paraphrasing: This involves restating what has been said in your own words to show that you understand and to encourage clarification. For example, "If I'm understanding you correctly, you're suggesting that we approach this problem from a different angle."

Nonverbal communication: This includes using body language, eye contact, and facial expressions to show that you are engaged and paying attention.

Visualization: This involves using diagrams, sketches, or other visual aids to help communicate ideas and concepts.

Silence: Sometimes, allowing a pause in the conversation can give the speaker time to gather their thoughts and provide a more thoughtful response.

A good Scrum Master will bring all of these coaching and facilitation techniques to their Scrum Teams and empower their teams to use them in order to effectively and independently solve problems and resolve conflicts.

It's not the Scrum Master's job to resolve conflicts or make decisions for the team. Instead, the Scrum Master will coach, facilitate and provide conflict resolution tools to the team so that they can resolve issues internally and on their own.

The Scrum Guide doesn't say the Scrum Master should remove obstacles for the team. Instead, it says the Scrum master should _cause_ the removal of impediments for the team. Coaching and facilitating the Scrum Team is one of the ways they do this.
