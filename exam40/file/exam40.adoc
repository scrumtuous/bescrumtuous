Halfway through the Sprint the development team has become uncomfortable with the Sprint Goal and feels a change needs to be made to bring it in line with the Sprint Plan.

According to the Scrum Guide, when can the Sprint Goal be changed or adjusted?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The Sprint Goal can be changed or adjusted any time the Product Goal is changed or adjusted.
* [ ] B. The Sprint Goal can be changed or adjusted any time during the Daily Scrum.
* [ ] C. A Sprint Goal can be changed or adjusted any time during the Sprint.
* [*] D. The Sprint Goal must be finalized before the end of Sprint Planning and it cannot be changed throughout the Sprint.
* [ ] E. The Sprint Goal must be finalized before the development Sprint starts and it cannot be changed throughout the Sprint.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
The Sprint Goal must be finalized before the end of Sprint Planning and it cannot be changed throughout the Sprint.

According to the Scrum Guide, during Sprint planning, "the whole Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning."

Note that there are no 'development Sprints' in Scrum. There are just Sprints.

There are also no:

- Sprint Zeros
- Release Sprints
- Infrastructure Sprints
- Integration Sprints

Furthermore, all of the Scrum Events take place within a Sprint. 

- The Sprint does not start after Sprint Planning. 
- The Sprint Review does not happen after the Sprint finishes

A Sprint starts, and then all of the events take place within that Sprint. And when a Sprint ends after the Sprint Retrospective concludes, a new Sprint begins immediately. There is no time between Sprints in Scrum.

==== Answer 2
****


[#query]
--
As the Scrum Master, it is clear to you that the Sprint Goal is not going to be achieved if the Sprint Backlog isn't adjusted and new Product Backlog items aren't added. 

In Scrum, who has the right to add new Product Backlog items (PBIs) to the Sprint Backlog?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The Product Owner prioritizes Product Backlog items and has the authority to add PBIs to the Sprint Backlog.
* [*] B. The development team owns the Sprint Backlog and can add items to it at any time during the Sprint.
* [ ] C. Both the Scrum Master and the developers can add to the Sprint Backlog if  changes need to be made to keep the Sprint Goal in focus.
* [ ] D. Anyone on the Scrum Team can add or remove items from the Sprint Backlog.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--
The development team has full control over the Sprint Backlog. Only the development team has the authority to add or remove PBIs selected for the Sprint Backlog.

Anyone can discuss the Sprint Backlog with the development team and relay any concerns to them, but it is the development team that has the final say over what is added or removed.

If anyone thinks the Sprint can be improved through the addition or deletion of the Sprint Backlog, they are welcome to discuss those thoughts with the developers. Whether they can convice the developers to act on those discussions is another story.

Developers own the Sprint Backlog.

How might a Scrum Master help the Scrum Team resolve an internal disagreement that has caused inter-personal conflicts between team members.
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Use various coaching and facilitation techniques such as open feedback and active listening.
* [*] B. Involve everyone on the team of Scrum Developers in forming a resolution that is in line with the Scrum values.
* [ ] C. Ask an external consultant on the production team to determine the most sensible path forward.
* [ ] D. Incorporate the Human Resources (HR) department to help resolve any inter-personal conflicts that have arisen.
* [*] E. Coach the team on maintaining a psychologically safe environment for all participants.
--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, B and E.

[#explanation]
--
A Scrum Team is expected to be cross-functional and have all the skills needed to address issues that arise. The team should be able to make independent decisions without consulting external specialists.

A self-managed, cross-functional team is also expected to resolve conflicts on their own. From the Scrum perspective, and certainly on the Scrum Master certification exam, going to Human Resources to resolve a problem is not a prescribed approach. 

The Scrum Guide never once mentions the term "Human Resources,' nor is it even reasonable to assume that every team doing Scrum would have a Human Resources department. Avoid any options on a Scrum Master exam question that references HR.

A Scrum Master _coaches and facilitates_ in order to help the development team come to their own conclusions and find paths to help them move forward.

Accodring to the Scrum Guide, which of the following are duties of a Scrum Master?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Participating as an equal member of the Scrum team while also acting as a leader who serves.
* [ ] B. Assigning action items for team members to complete during the Sprint.
* [ ] C. Communicating the development team's answers to stakeholder questions through transcription, email or direct communication.
* [ ] D. Taking dictation during the Daily Scrum and reporting discussions that take place during the Daily Scrum back to management.
* [ ] E. Scheduling meetings and booking conference rooms for the team.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is A.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Guide says the Scrum Master is a leader who serves. Note that it does not say the Scrum Master is a 'servant-leader.' 

'Leader who serves' is the new terminology.

It is not the job of the Scrum Master to perform secretarial duties for the Scrum Team, nor is it the job of the Scrum Master to be a liason between management and the developers.

The job of the Scrum Master is to:

- Act as a leader first and a servant to the team second
- Coach and facilitate the Scrum Team and the organization on the application of Scrum
- Ensure the rules of Scrum are observed and coach around instances when they are violated
- Cause the removal of impediments (_cause_ the removal, not actually _remove_)
- Help to create a psychologically safe space for everyone involved

A Scrum Master never expected to:

- Assigns tasks
- Disciplines developers
- Run the Daily Scrum
- Select Product Backlog items
- Cancel a Sprint IOnly a PO can)
- Override the decisions of the developers

Coach, facilitate and behave as a leader who serves are the key responsibilities of the Scrum Master.

They've just told you, the Scrum Master, that there's no way they are even going to come close to completing the Sprint Backlog.

What should you, as the Scrum Master, do?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Change the Definition of Done and negotiate the quality standard with the Product Owner to ensure all Sprint Backlog items are completed before the end of the Sprint.
* [*] B. While the Sprint is ongoing, have the Product Owner and the developers negotiate the scope of the work being done so as not to endanger the Sprint Goal.
* [ ] C. Scale out and assign some of the Sprint Backlog items to an external Scrum Team.
* [ ] D. Inform the Product Owner prior to the Sprint Review so the stakeholders won't be disappointed.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--
It's not unusual to have a Sprint go sideways. When that happens, the Scrum Team has to adapt.

It's acceptable to clarify and negotiate scope during a Sprint. In fact, it would be difficult to imagine a Sprint where the PO and the developers don't spend some time negotiating the scope of the Sprint.

After all, some tasks will get completed faster than expected. Other tasks might take longer. When that happens, developers should sit down with the PO and figure out what items they might want to add to the Sprint Backlog or which items they might want to remove. 

Open discussions like this will occur naturally on any healthy product development team. 

According to the Scrum Guide:

"During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality does not decrease;
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned."

==== Answer 6
****


[#query]
--
The Scrum team needs to hire an outside specialist, external to the Scrum team, to deliver wireframes needed in order to complete a Product Backlog item and meet the Definition of Done. Some of the developers have complained to you, the Scrum Master, in confidence about the outside specialist. 

What are your main concerns in this situation?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. You are concerned that the external dependency may impact software development velocity.
* [*] B. You are concerned that team members are coming to you with complaints rather than figuring out a solution themselves within the team.
* [*] C. You are concerned about the ability of the development team to produce a fully integrated Increment when meeting the Definition of Done depends on work produced by someone outside of the Scrum Team.
* [ ] D. You are worried that there will be software developers sitting idle while work is outsourced.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are B and C.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Team should have all the skills required to meet the Definition of Done (DoD). If the DoD depends on work performed outside of the team, there is no control over it and it jeopardizes the team's ability to create a full Increment.

The development team should also be self-organized and self-managed, which implies that they should be able to discuss and resolve concerns internally. Openness and transparency may be lacking if developers are complaining to the Scrum Master in secrecy.

The Scrum Master should work hard to make the workplace a psychologically safe space where developers feel free to discuss their fears and concerns openly and honestly with each other. Secrecy is not consistent with the Scrum pillar of transparency.

****


[#query]
--
If the company you work for does not have an organizational standard that defines the Definition of Done, whose responsibility is it to provide a definition before development begins?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The development team
* [ ] B. The Product Owner
* [*] C. The Scrum Team, which includes the Scrum Master and Product Owner
* [ ] D. The Definition of Done is formed from a consensus between the Scrum Master and the Product Owner

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
According to the Scrum Guide:

"If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. 

If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product."

In Scrum, the Definition of Done (DoD) is a shared understanding of what it means for a Product Backlog item to be considered complete and ready to be integrated into the product. The Scrum Team, which includes the Product Owner, the development team and the Scrum Master, collaborates to create the Definition of Done if an organizational standard for the DoD does not already exist.

Almost everything that happens in Scrum happens within the confines of a Sprint. The Definition of Done is one of the few items references in the Scrum Guide that should exist before the first Sprint begins. After all, a team can't really do any Sprint Planning without an established Definition of Done.

After development starts, discussions about updating or adjusting the Definition of Done should happen during the Sprint Retrospective.

Ultimately, the Definition of Done should be agreed upon by the entire Scrum Team and should reflect the standards and expectations for delivering a high-quality product to the customer.

Under which circumstance can the Scrum Master extend the length of the Sprint once the Sprint has started?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. The Sprint can be extended equal to the number of days a Product Owner is absent
* [ ] B. The Sprint can be extended equal to the number of holidays that occurred during the Sprint
* [ ] C. The Sprint length can be changed any time prior to the end of the Sprint Planning meeting
* [*] D. The Sprint length cannot be changed after a Sprint has started


--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
-- 
Once a Sprint has started, the Sprint length cannot be changed.

Changes to the length of the Sprint should be agreed upon by a consensus of the team. 

The best time to discuss changing the length of the Sprint is during the Sprint Retrospective. Any changes made to the Sprint length during a Sprint would apply only to future Sprints, not the current Sprint. Once a Sprint starts, its length cannot be changed.

* [ ] A. Standup Meetings.
* [ ] B. The Release Sprint.
* [*] C. The Sprint Retrospective.
* [*] D. Sprint Planning. 
* [ ] E. Stakeholder Meetings.
* [ ] F. Sprint Zero.
* [*] G. The Daily Scrum.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are C, D and G.

[#explanation]
--
The Sprint Retrospective is a timeboxed event that occurs at the end of each Sprint and allows the team to reflect on their processes and identify areas for improvement. The Sprint Retrospective is timeboxed to a maximum of 3 hours.

Sprint Planning is also timeboxed and occurs at the beginning of each Sprint, allowing the team to plan and prioritize their work for the upcoming Sprint. Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of 8 hours.

The Daily Scrum is another timeboxed event that occurs daily during the Sprint and allows the team to synchronize their work and plan for the day. The Daily Scrum is timeboxed to a maximum of 15 minutes.

The Sprint Review is also timeboxed to a maximum of 4 hours, although the Sprint Review was not mentioned in this question.

Options A, B, E, and F are not correct because they are not Scrum events. On any Scrum exam, references to standup meetings, release Sprints, stakeholder meetings and Sprint Zero will likely be red herrings designed to trick you into selecting an incorrect answer. These topics are never mentioned at all in the Scrum Guide.

* [ ] B. The Product Owner must always attend the Daily Scrum to help remove any impediments that exist that jeopardize the Sprint Goal
* [ ] B. The Product Owner must always attend the Daily Scrum so they can quickly answer any questions the Scrum Developers have about items they are working on.
* [ ] C. The Product Owner must always attend the Daily Scrum to present the stakeholder's point of view.
* [*] D. The Product Owner doesn't need to attend the Daily Scrum.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
The Product Owner does not participate in the the Daily Scrum, nor are they required to attend it. They only participate in the Daily Scrum at the behest of the Scrum Developers. For example, the developers might phone the Product Owner during a Daily Scrum to get clarification on a topic, or perhaps send them a text message. But the Product Owner is not required to attend the Daily Scrum, and they only participate if the developers need their input.

In fact, not even the Scrum Master is required to attend the Daily Scrum, and they are not allowed to actively participate in it. Like they Product Owner, a Scrum Master only participates in the Daily Scrum at the behest of the developers.

The Daily Scrum is for the developers.

Unless the Scrum Master or Product Owner is actually doing development for some reason and acting as a developer working on a backlog item, then they should not participate in the Daily Scrum. The Daily Scrum is only for the developers.

* [ ] A. When a self-managed team of Scrum Developers realizes the work committed to during Sprint planning cannot possibly be delivered by the end of the Sprint.
* [*] B. When the Sprint Goal no longer makes sense and becomes obsolete.
* [ ] C. When the Scrum Development team's work needs to be redirected to new opportunities.
* [ ] D. When the Product Owner reprioritized the Product Backlog and PBIs currently under development are no longer priorities.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--

When the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete the Product Owner can canel the Sprint.

In Scrum, the Sprint Goal is a short statement that describes what the Development Team intends to achieve during the Sprint. It provides focus and direction to the team and helps to ensure that all members are working towards a common objective. The Sprint Goal is set during Sprint Planning and remains unchanged throughout the Sprint.

If the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, it means that the objective that the Scrum Developers set for the Sprint is no longer relevant. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as changes in the business environment or new information that makes the Sprint Goal irrelevant. Essentially, something happened that makes working towards the Sprint Goal a complete waste of time.

When the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, the Scrum framework allows for the Sprint to be cancelled by the Product Owner.

It is important to note that cancelling a Sprint is not a decision that should be taken lightly. If Sprints are cancelled frequently, it can indicate deeper problems with the project that need to be addressed.

* [ ] C. The current Sprint is temporarily extended to allow all Sprint Backlog items to be completed. Insight is garnered at the Sprint Retrospective and the team adapts to avoid this situation in the future.
* [ ] D. The Sprint Review is postponed until all selected Sprint Backlog items are completed.


--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is B.

[#explanation]
--
There is no changing the Sprint length during an active Sprint.

During the Sprint Retrospective, a Scrum Team can discuss the Sprint length and possibly adjust the length of future Sprints, but the length of an active Sprint is fixed and cannot be changed. Sprint Reviews and Sprint Restrospectives will occur at their scheduled time and place.

It's not uncommon for some Sprint Backlog items to go uncompleted during a Sprint. When that happens, they just go back into the Product Backlog.

The team can always discuss why their estimates were off, or why they couldn't complete as many PBIs as they wanted to during the Sprint Retrospective. The Scrum Team should turn the situation into a learning experience and adapt accordingly. That's what Scrum is all about!

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, C and D.

[#explanation]

Key responsibilities of the Scrum Master include:

- Causing the removing obstacles the team encounters
- Protecting the Scrum Team from external interruptions
- Helping the entire organization enact a lean and empirical approach to problem solving. 

Additionally the Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum process is being followed and encourages self-organization and cross-functionality among the Scrum Team members.

The Scrum Master should not be seen as a police officer or trailer-park supervisor enforcing rules and commanding others to act. They Scrum Master coaches, facilitates and acts as a leader who serves.

However, there are rules in the Scrum Guide that do need to be respected, one of which is the time-box for Scrum events. There aren't a lot of rules in the Scrum Guide, but when the few rules that exist are violated, it's the job of the Scrum Master to coach the team on the importance on respecting the ethos of Scrum.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are C and D.

[#explanation]
--
Coaching and teaching are important parts of the Scrum Master's role as a leader who serves.

Active listening and open questioning are important skills in effective communication, particularly in Scrum where collaboration and continuous feedback are key. However, there are other techniques and approaches that can also be useful in communication, including:

Reflective listening: This involves reflecting back what the speaker has said to demonstrate that you understand their message. For example, "So what I hear you saying is that you're concerned about the timeline for this project."

Summarizing: This involves summarizing what has been said to ensure that everyone is on the same page. For example, "Let me make sure I understand - you're saying that we need to focus on improving the user experience for this feature."

Paraphrasing: This involves restating what has been said in your own words to show that you understand and to encourage clarification. For example, "If I'm understanding you correctly, you're suggesting that we approach this problem from a different angle."

Nonverbal communication: This includes using body language, eye contact, and facial expressions to show that you are engaged and paying attention.

Visualization: This involves using diagrams, sketches, or other visual aids to help communicate ideas and concepts.

Silence: Sometimes, allowing a pause in the conversation can give the speaker time to gather their thoughts and provide a more thoughtful response.

A good Scrum Master will bring all of these coaching and facilitation techniques to their Scrum Teams and empower their teams to use them in order to effectively and independently solve problems and resolve conflicts.

It's not the Scrum Master's job to resolve conflicts or make decisions for the team. Instead, the Scrum Master will coach, facilitate and provide conflict resolution tools to the team so that they can resolve issues internally and on their own.

The Scrum Guide doesn't say the Scrum Master should remove obstacles for the team. Instead, it says the Scrum master should _cause_ the removal of impediments for the team. Coaching and facilitating the Scrum Team is one of the ways they do this.

* [*] C. End the Sprint early.
* [ ] D. Coach the Development Team to ensure the Daily Scrum is timeboxed to 15 minutes.
* [*] E. Reprimand developers who underperform.
--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, B, C and E.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Master is a leader who serves the team and as such, should never _tell_ the developers what to do. The Scrum Master coaches and facilitates and allows developers to discover solutions and solve problems themselves.

Furthermore, the Scrum Framework does not allow the length of a Sprint to be extended, and only the Product Owner can end a Sprint early.

The Scrum Master does coach teams about the Scrum Framework, so coaching a team to ensure the 15 minute Daily Scrum timebox is not exceeded is a good use of the Scrum Master's time.

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
A trend line of a release burndown chart indicates how fast work is being completed relative to the original plan, and can help visualize progress toward completion of the component being graphed, be it a Sprint or a decomposed Product Backlog item.

"A burn down chart enables the team to visualize the progress on a project. A burn down chart includes work remaining on the Y axis against a timeline of the project on the X axis. Depending on the project, these charts can measure work as user stories, tasks, backlogs or other metrics."

- Project Management Tools, TechTarget, Jan 2020. M. Courtemanche.

The Scrum Guide only makes a short reference to burndown charts, and even then, it says they are not a replacement for empiricism.

You don't need to be a burndown chart expert, but knowing what one is will keep you from being caught off guard on the Scrum certification exam.

* [ ] A. A Product Backlog item is complete when a Quality Assurance team verifies that the work passes all acceptance criteria, making it ready for release
* [ ] B. A Product Backlog item is complete when all work in the Sprint Backlog related to the item is finished, making it ready for release
* [*] C. A Product Backlog item is complete when it meets the Definition of Done and further Increments of work on it are no longer possible, making it ready for release.
* [ ] D. Product Backlog items are never officially complete until the Product Goal is achieved.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
A Product Backlog item is complete when all of its features are completed, meet the Definition of Done, and it is not possible to create any further Increments out of it.

A Product Backlog item is not necessarily associated with a single Increment of Work. A PBI may get decomposed into multiple, smaller pieces and work. Work on a decomposed PBI can last multiple Sprints, with each Sprint producing an Increment that meets a Definition of Done for a given facet of that Product Backlog item. 

That's why PBIs are decomposed by the development team - to break them up into manageable pieces of work that can be spread out over time and be planned out more accurately.

* [ ] C. The ability to complete a development project within budget and within the timeline agreed upon with the Product Owner.
* [ ] D. The ability to take direction from the Scrum Master and complete Product Backlog items assigned to them by the Product Owner.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is A.

[#explanation]
--
The Scrum Developers must be able to decompose a PBI and create as many Increments of work that are necessary to complete the PBI and make the item ready for potential release.

A Product Backlog item (PBI) is often a very _high-level_ description of a feature or a function. The Product Owner will know what they want, but they won't always know how to 'get there' or describe it in sufficient detail for the to fully understand what is needed. This requires the developers to work with the Product Owner to decompose the Product Backlog item into smaller, constituent parts that are easier to estimate, plan and build.

For example, maybe a Product Owner wants to build a house. They are unlikely to have anything in the Product Backlog about pouring a foundation or connecting to the main sewage line. Those are details the Scrum Developers will have to flush out as they decompose the Product Backlog items.

Decomposing a PBI means breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces of work that can be completed by the Scrum Developers during a Sprint. The goal is to decompose Product Backlog items down into units of work that can be completed in a single day.

The process of decomposing a PBI involves analyzing it in more detail, identifying sub-tasks, dependencies and other factors involved, and then creating smaller Product Baclkog items that can be individually prioritized, estimated, and worked on by the team. This allows the team to better understand the requirements of the PBI and the work involved, which in turn helps with planning and delivering the work effectively.

Decomposition is an ongoing process that takes place throughout every Sprint. 

As the team progresses through the Sprint, they may discover additional details or dependencies that require further decomposition of Product Baclkog items, or they may need to adjust their plan based on feedback from stakeholders or changes in the product's requirements. By continually decomposing Product Baclkog items, the team can ensure they have a clear understanding of the work involved, which helps the team prioritize, estimate, and deliver Product Backlog items more transparently.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
Don't worry too much about burn-down charts, as they are only briefly mentioned in the Scrum Guide.

"Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While
proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism." - The Scrum Guide.

A trend line displayed on a release burndown chart indicates the progress of a project over time. The release burndown chart is a visual representation of the amount of work remaining to complete a project, plotted against time. The generated trend line represents the expected progress of the project if it were to continue at the same rate as it has been progressing up to that point in time.

It is important to note that the trend line is a projection based on past performance, and it may not accurately predict the future progress of the project. It is a predictor, but it is not an _empirical_ measure. Empirical measures are preferred in Scrum.

The team's developers are amazing! Maybe too amazing?

It's not even half-way through the Sprint and the developers are telling you, the Scrum Master, that they have not selected enough items for the Sprint. Everything is practically done, which will result in developers being underutilized with nothing to do for the rest of the Sprint.

If developers complete Sprint Backlog items quickly and become underutilized, they should adapt and add new Product Backlog items to the Sprint Backlog.

Scrum is pragmatic. Scrum's rules allow for simple solutions to problems that arise.

If developers didn't select enough work, then let them select more work. It's really that simple.

Never overcomplicate Scrum.

During every Sprint, the team attempts to create at least one Increment to present to stakeholders during the Sprint Review.

Why might a Product Owner refuse to immediately release an Increment into production after a successful Sprint Review?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Increments are automatically released into production so it is not possible to refuse a release.
* [ ] B. The Product Owner needs confirmation from the Scrum Master in order to release an Increment into production.
* [*] C. The immediate timing of the release does not make sense for customers or stakeholders.
* [ ] D. The Product Owner never refuses to release an Increment into production.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
If the timing of the release of an Increment is not in the best interest of users or stakeholders, the Product Owner does not need to release it immediately.

For example, a Christmas Theme for the website might be completed in late October. You wouldn't publish the website's Christmas theme two months before Christmas.

Increments don't need to be released or published immediately. They can be released when they make the most sense for the organization, stakeholders and customers.

* [ ] E. When will infrastructure required for deployment will be ready?

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, B and C.

[#explanation]
--
According to the Scrum Guide, a Sprint Planning meeting addresses these three questions:

- Why is this Sprint valuable?
- What can be Done this Sprint?
- How will the chosen work get done?

Always remember that _why, what and how_ are the questions to be answered before the end of the Sprint Planning event.

Who on the Scrum Team has the responsibility of ordering the Product Backlog?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. The Product Owner orders the Product Backlog, with the items that deliver the most value to the stakeholders at the top.
* [ ] B. The Development Team orders the Product Backlog, with items listed chronologically according to what the development team should logically build first.
* [ ] C. The Scrum Master orders the Product Backlog, with the items that the Product Owner says will deliver the most value to the stakeholders at the top.
* [ ] D. The Product Owner prioritizes the Product Backlog, with PBIs with the highest story-points assigned to them first.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is A.

[#explanation]
--
In the Scrum framework, the Product Owner is responsible for creating and maintaining the Product Backlog, which is an ordered list of features, enhancements, and fixes that the Scrum Team will work on in order to deliver a product Increment. 

The Product Owner orders the items in the Product Backlog based on a variety of factors that relate to how the items bring value to the business. Generally speaking, items that are believed to provide the most value to the product's users and customers are placed at the top of the list, and those that are of lower priority are placed towards the bottom.

The Scrum Guide says the Product Backlog gets _ordered,_ not _prioritized._ Many seasoned Scrum Masters are surprised to learn that the 2020 Scrum Guide never once uses the word _prioritized._

What should be done with a Product Backlog item (PBI) that did not meet the Scrum Team's agreed upon Definition of Done by the end of a Sprint?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Return the item to the Product Backlog.
* [ ] B. With the consent of the Product Owner and stakeholders, the PBI can be approved and released.
* [ ] C. Automatically add the unfinished PBI to the next Sprint's backlog.
* [*] D. Make sure the team knows that work on this PBI will not be included in the current Sprint's Increment.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and D.

[#explanation]
--
Incomplete PBIs not completed in a given Sprint are returned to the Product Backlog.

They are not automatically added to the next Sprint, as priorities may have changed since the prior round of Sprint Planning took place.

If a PBI is not completed, it definitely should not be added to the Increment. The Incrememt is only for completed work that meets the DoD.

The Product Backlog is the ordered list of features, requirements, and other work items that the development team plans to complete over the course of the project. During each Sprint, the team selects a subset of items from the Product Backlog to work on, creating a Sprint Backlog.

One of the key principles of Scrum is that the team commits to completing the work it selects for the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint. However, if any Product Backlog items are not completed by the end of the Sprint, they are not automatically added to the next Sprint Backlog. Instead, they are returned to the Product Backlog for reordering and consideration for future Sprints.

According to the Scrum Guide, which two of the following statements is true about the Product Owner?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. The Product Owner may delegate the creation of Product Backlog items to an associate.
* [ ] B. The Product Owner may be a committee or collection of individuals who collaboratively perform the role.
* [*] C. The organization must fully respect and trust the independent decisions of the Product Owner.
* [ ] D. The Product Owner should coach the developers in self-management and cross-functionality.
* [ ] E. The Product Owner must attend and participate in the Daily Scrum.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and C.

[#explanation]
--

The Product Owner is allowed to delegate certain aspects of their job to others on the team, as the Scrum Guide indicates:

"The Product Owner ... may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable. For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review. The Product Owner is one person, not a committee."

The organization must also fully trust the decisions of the Product Owner. The PO must be trusted to make quick decisions about the product so that developers can get fast responses and quickly resolve issues.

You are building a limo for a head of state, and security and protection of the occupant are two important, non-functional requirements that must be prioritized at every step in the development process. 

What is the best way to ensure security and protection of the occupant are prioritized?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Outsource security and protection concerns to an external third party that specializes in these areas.
* [ ] B. Add a Sprint prior to the release of the car that deals exclusively with security and protection.
* [ ] C. Build a special sub-team on the development team that deals exclusively with security and protection of the occupant.
* [*] D. Have the Product Owner add the features that pertain to security and protection of the occupant to the Product Backlog.
* [*] E. Add concerns related to the security and protection of the occupant to the Definition of Done.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are D and E.

[#explanation]
--
We don't outsource work in Scrum, nor do we create sub-teams. 

From the Scrum Guide: "Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal."

In Scrum, we deal with non-functional requirements by either adding Product Backlog items that address these concerns, or we add non-functional criteria to the Definition of Done.

[#query]
--
You, the Scrum Master, have been told that the quality assurance (QA) tests performed by an external team have been delayed, and due to this delay, it's unlikely the Definition of Done will be achieved before the end of this 3-week Sprint. However, if the Sprint was extended a week, the QA work would likely be done. 

How would you proceed as a Scrum Master? (Choose 2)
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Extend the Sprint a week to allow the QA team to complete their work.
* [*] B. Investigate why the Scrum Team does not have all the cross-functional skills to achieve the Definition of Done without an external QA team
* [ ] C. Remove QA work from the Definition of Done for this Sprint.
* [*] D. Explain to the organization that Scrum is not designed to manage the work performed by people external to the Scrum Team.
* [ ] E. Turn the next Sprint into a 'Performance and Security' sprint and focus on these two non-functional aspects of the code.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are B and D.

[#explanation]
--
A Scrum Team must have all of the skills necessary to complete the Definition of Done. The Scrum Team cannot outsource work that is part of their Definition of Done and still have that work managed through Scrum.

Extending the Sprint is never an option. The Sprint length is fixed when the Sprint starts.

The Definition of Done can always be discussed and updated. However, the Scrum Master does not have the right to unilaterally change the Definition of Done, and changes to the Definition of Done are best discussed in the Sprint Retrospective.

Furthermore, the Definition of Done should not be changed midway through a Sprint to accommodate moving goalposts. Doing so would be antithetical to Scrum. 

Of course, there is nothing in the Scrum Guide that explicitly forbids updating the Definition of Done mid-Sprint, but just keep in mind that all estimates and planning were made given the DoD that existed during Sprint Planning. A mid-Sprint change to the DoD has the potential to throw off all of those estimates and put the Sprint Goal at risk.

Changes to the Definition of Done are best to take place during the Sprint Retrospective.

What are the two primary responsibilities of a new Product Owner when taking ownership of a product that is currently under development with a long history of multiple, successful Sprints?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. Ensuring that the development teams know which Product Backlog items provide the greatest value and should be developed first
* [ ] B. Describing and fully decomposing product features in Use Case and story form.
* [ ] C. Providing detailed development specs and guidelines to the development team.
* [*] D. Interacting with stakeholders to learn how to represent their needs in the Product Backlog.
* [ ] E. Creating both functional and non-functional tests to validate the Increment meets the Definition of Done.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A and D.

[#explanation]
--
The Product Owner must order the Product Backlog so that developers know which items provide the most value. If possible, the Product Owner will negotiate with the team to ensure these items get developed first.

Also, according to the Scrum Guide, "The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog." So interacting with and collaborating with stakeholders is important.

Scrum doesn't work if there isn't buy-in from the entire organization, including management.

How do members of the management group in an organization that sponsors a development project support a Scrum Team?
--

[#list]
--
* [*] A. The organization empowers the Scrum Team to manage their own work.
* [ ] B. The organization responds quickly to daily status updates from the Scrum Master.
* [*] C. The organization must provide Scrum Teams with resources that allow for continual improvement.
* [*] D. The organization fully respects and trusts the Product Owner's decisions.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answers are A, C and D.

[#explanation]
--
Status updates are antithetical to the Scrum Framework. Scrum provides other artifacts and mechanisms to allow for transparency and openness into the progress of the Scrum Team.

Providing sufficient input and resources for the Scrum Team to improve, allowing the Scrum Team to manage their own work, and respecting the decisions of the Product Owner are three concrete ways an organization can support teams that practice Scrum.

Self-organization and self-management are two important attributes of a Scrum Team.

What is most important criteria for developers to think about when they self-organize into development teams?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Does each team have a strong and competent team lead?
* [ ] B. Is there a good balance of senior and junior developers?
* [ ] C. Will each team be able to form a sub-group for QA and testing?
* [*] D. Will the team have the cross-functional skills needed to build the product?

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is D.

[#explanation]
--
There are no subteams, titles or hierarchies on Scrum Teams.

All that matters when a group of Scrum Developers is assembled is whether they have, or do they have the ability to acquire, the cross-functional skills matrix needed to build the product under development and achieve the Product Goal.

From the Scrum Guide: "Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal. Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

When should new developers be added to a Scrum team?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. During Sprint Zero the team size should be set for the duration of the project.
* [ ] B. After the current Sprint ends but before the next Sprint begins.
* [*] C. When adding a new developer will help development continue at a sustainable pace.
* [ ] D. When the Project Manager provides enough budget money for a new developer.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
A new developer can be added to a project at any point in time. There is no rule barring a developer from joining a Scrum team during Sprint Planning, the Sprint Retrospective or even half-way through a Sprint.

Sustainable development is an important Agile principle. Developers should always be challenged and motivated, but they should never be overworked. If a new developer needs to be added to the team to maintain sustainable development, then add them. 

Just keep in mind that onboarding will sometimes reduce the team's productivity in the short-term, as training and orientation for the new hire will likely occupy some of your developer's time.

Scrum practitioners are encouraged to focus on the current Sprint, and while the Product Goal should always be 'top of mind', Scrum does not plan two or three Sprints into the future. This is an example of which Scrum value?
--

[#list]
--
* [ ] A. Courage.
* [ ] B. Respect.
* [*] C. Focus.
* [ ] D. Openness.
* [ ] E. Honesty.

--
****

[#answer]

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]
--
One of the key principles of Scrum is to maintain a clear focus on the current Sprint and avoid distractions from other work that is not part of the Sprint. This principle of focusing on the Sprint is intended to ensure that the team can deliver high-quality work and achieve its Sprint Goal without being sidetracked by other priorities.

This is also a recognition of the fact that things can change quickly, especially after a Sprint Review or Sprint Retrospective, so planning beyond the current Sprint is often a complete waste of time.

By not looking beyond the current Sprint, the development team is able to maintain  focus and avoid getting distracted by future work that may not be relevant or may change over time. This helps the team to remain agile and respond quickly to changes in the market or in customer needs, since they are not locked into a fixed plan that may become obsolete.

Moreover, the Scrum framework provides regular opportunities to inspect and adapt the work done in the current Sprint and adjust the backlog accordingly. This allows the team to constantly improve the product and respond to feedback from stakeholders.
